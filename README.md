4. Click on the install now button.

WordPress will now upload the plugin file from your computer and install it for you. You will see a success message after the installation is finished. Press "Activate Plugin".

## Usage

The plugin is designed to work with our website "[yourwebsite.com](https://yourwebsite.com)" and our clients. This means that as soon as you upload it on your website, it will communicate with our API to find information about the domain is running from (one-way communication, we don't collect any data).

In order to use it for your own needs, alter the following variables in "plugin-settings.php" with your own data, now you can use it for your own clients.

```php
// edit your company info
$wpc['company_name'] = "Demo Company";
$wpc['company_website'] = "https://yourwebsite.com";
$wpc['company_email'] = "info@yourwebsite.com";
// api url to get the website information
$wpc['api_url'] = "https://your.api/url/here/json.php";
```

The **API** is easy to implement. At the moment, the plugin requests two types of data, **domain data** and **domain messages** to display on the dashboard.

### URL to request domain data:
```html
https://your.api/url/here/json.php?domain=client-domain.com&ver=1&action=data
```
#### The JSON output:
The plugin will recognize the following JSON output and will show the domain's data on client's dashboard.

```json
{"domain":"client-domain.com","dom_exp":"31-12-2020", 
"dom_renew":"https:\/\/yourwebsite.com\/","hosting":"Starter Hosting Plan, HDD 5GB, Bandwidth 50GB\/month", 
"hosting_exp":"31-12-2020","hosting_renew":"https:\/\/yourwebsite.com\/"}
```

### URL to get domain messages:
```html
https://your.api/url/here/json.php?domain=client-domain.com&ver=1&action=messages
```
#### The JSON output:
The plugin will recognize the following JSON output and will show the messages on client's dashboard.
```json
["10-01-2020:::The Message for our client.","11-01-2020:::Another Message for our client."]
```
